You can now create a new app using one of the\nStarter Kit Templates. These have been created to include all the key components,configuration and frameworks to get you starting on\ncreating the code your need for your solutions.\n\n## Demonstration Video\n<Video src=\"/videos/deployfirstapp.m4v\" type=\"video/m4v\" poster=\"/images/poster.png\">\n</Video>\n\n### Open the Developer Dashboard\n\nThe Developer dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools and includes a section that\nlists the **Starter Kits Templates**. These templates have been created to give you a more comprehensive\nstarting point for you apps. Read more in the **[Starter Kits](/starterkits/overview)**.\n\n- Open the Development Dashboard, simple instructions are listed [here](/getting-started/dashboard)\n- Click on **Starter Kits** tab\n\n- Make sure you have installed the **Developer Tools CLI** before continuing\n    ```bash\n    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli\n    ```\n- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for you application and the Language and Framework\nthat you prefer to work with. Click on the **Tile** to create a new copy from the template.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nThe templates use the GitHub Templating feature, this means that they will be created into\nyou Git organisation of your choice with no git history. If you click on the tile it takes you\nstraight to the template view. If you click on the **Git Icon** it takes you to the source Git Repo\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n- This will open the the GitHub template generate view. You can see the source git repo displayed\nat the top.\n    ![Template](template.png)\n- Enter a validate **name** for you project\n- Enter a **description** to describe your app\n- Select a validate Git Organization that you are authorised to create repositories within.\n\n- Click on **Create repository from template*\n\n- The new repository will be created, next step is to Clone it to your local machine, click\non **Clond or download**\n- Copy the clone SSH link, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.\n    ```base\n    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git\n    cd stockbffnode\n    ```\n\n### Running Locally\n\nMost developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. Follow the instructions\nlisted in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. They may be requirements to install\nspecific runtime's like **Java**, **Node** and **Python**\n\n### Register App Pipeline\n\nNow you have the code in a Git Repository and cloned to you local development environment.\nWe can now register the repository with Continuous Integration pipeline technology. The default\nis **Jenkins**. We use the `igc` command line to make this step as simple as possible.\n\n- You will need your GitHub personal access token with web hook authority,\nNavigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click **Generate new token**.\nSave the token and place it in your clipboard.\n\n- To register the app follow these steps.\n    ```bash\n    igc pipeline\n    ? Please provide the username for https://github.com/mjperrins/hello-world-bff.git: mperrins\n    ? Please provide your password/personal access token: [hidden]\n    ? Please provide the branch the pipeline should use: master\n    Creating git secret\n    Copying 'ibmcloud-apikey' secret to dev\n    Registering pipeline\n    ```\n- Enter your GitHub user id, past your Personal Access token and select the default git branch or type\nin another branch you want to register.\n\n-- The pipeline will be registered.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nNote: Tekton support will be coming soon.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n### View App Pipeline\n\nUsing the Developer Dashboard, navigate back to you Jenkins instance. If you have it open\nalready refresh the page.\n\n- You will see you pipeline registered.\n\n- Click on your app pipeline and click **Build Now**.\n\n- Wait for the pipeline stages to start building.\n\n- Open it has complete you should see a view similar to the one below.\n\n![Jenkins Pipeline](pipeline.png)\n\n### Access running App\n\nOnce the pipeline has completed successfully the app will be deployed into the `dev` namespace\nin Kubernetes or Openshift. You can now access the app to test it.\n\n- To Access the app, retrieve the app ingress endpoint using command below.\n    ```bash\n    igc ingress -n dev\n    ```\n- You will see a list of apps displayed with their ingress URL.\n    ```base\n    Host(s):\n    [\n      'http://stockbffapp-dev.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'\n    ]\n\n- You can now open this ingress URL in your browser to validate its working as expected.\n\n- This completes the deployment of your first app.\n\n### Whats Next\n\nNow that you have a running application that is being built and deployed into your development cluster.\nThe next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code Analysis and Artifact management.\n\nTo enable this complete the setup of the **ArgoCD** and **Artifactory** using these instructions:\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/getting-started/argocd-setup\">ArgoCD Setup</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/getting-started/artifactory-setup\">Artifactory Setup</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n\n## Guides\n\nFor more detailed instructions of how to enable to the full developer lifecycle read through the **Guides** section.\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/guides/overview\">Guides</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/starterkits/overview\">Starter Kit Templates</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"845bd358237eb84fd54c677c8ae3bf03","counter":430,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying First App"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Deploying First App\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nNow you have prepared your development cluster for Cloud Native application development.
