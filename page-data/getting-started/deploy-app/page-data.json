These have been created to include all the key\ncomponents, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you need for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for a set of tools installed into **IBM Kubernetes** or **Red Hat OpenShift** managed service.\n\n### Demonstration video\n\nThis video will demo how to get started with using the Dashboard to develop and deploy an app.\nIt shows how to do the steps that are described below.\n\n<Video src=\"/videos/deployapp.m4v\" type=\"video/m4v\" poster=\"/images/poster.png\"/>\n\n### Open the Developer Tools Dashboard\n\nThe Developer Tools Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a section that\nlists the [Starter Kit Templates](/starterkits/overview). These templates have been created to give you \na more comprehensive starting point for you apps.\n\n- Make sure you have installed all [Prerequisites](/installation/pre-reqs) listed before continuing\n- Open the [Developer Tools Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard)\n    ```\n    igc dashboard\n    ```\n- Click on **Starter Kits** tab\n- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that you prefer to work with.\n    - Click on the tile to create a new repository copy from the template repository.\n    - You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the template repository.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nEach Starter Kit Template is a [GitHub template repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository).\nThis feature copies the directory structure and files of a template repository into a new repository in your organisation with no git history.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n- Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) view to create the new repository\n  - You can see the source git repo displayed at the top\n  - **Owner**: Select a validate GitHub organization that you are authorised to create repositories within\n  - **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n  **Warning:** If you are working on a shared education cluster to make it easy to identify your app please suffix the app name with your initials ie. `stockbffnode-mjp`\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n  - **Description**: Describe your app\n    ![Template](template.png)\n  - Press **Create repository from template**\n\nThe new repository will be created in your selected organization. Next, clone it to your local machine.\n- Click on **Clone or download**\n- Copy the clone _SSH link_, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.\n    ```base\n    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git\n    cd stockbffnode\n    ```\n\n- You must rename the app to match your git repo or a name that is unique for your solution.\n\n\n### Running Locally\n\nMost developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions\nlisted in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. You may be required to install a\nspecific runtime like **Java**, **Node**, or **Python**\n\n### Register the App in a DevOps Pipeline\n\nYou now have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment.\nYou can now register the repository with the **Continuous Integration** pipeline technology.\n\nThe default CI pipeline tool is currently **Jenkins**. ([Tekton support is also supported](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton))\n\n- Install the [Prerequisites](/installation/pre-reqs) listed before continuing\n- We use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to assist helping register a pipeline with Jenkins\n\n#### Register the repo with Jenkins\n- Open a terminal\n- Make sure you are logged into your Development cluster in a terminal.\n- To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and\nfollow the instructions to login from the command line\n- You can test this with the following simple command.\n\n<Accordion>\n\n  <AccordionItem title=\"OpenShift\">\n\n    oc get nodes\n\n  </AccordionItem>\n\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n    kubectl get nodes\n\n  </AccordionItem>\n\n</Accordion>\n\n<p></p>\n\n- Change to the repo directory\n    ```bash\n    cd {path to cloned repo}\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n  **Warning:** If you are working on a shared education cluster please deploy your app into a unique project/namespace that is unique to you as a developer and continue to do this for all other app creation steps. ie. `igc pipeline -n mooc-one-mjp`\n\n  This will isolate your pipelines from other developers working on the same cluster.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n- Register your repo using the `igc pipeline` command. The CLI will read the Git repo information from the directory and prompt for the credentials required to access the repo.\n    - **Username**: Enter your GitHub user id\n    - **Password**: Paste your personal access token\n    - **Branch**: Press enter for the default git branch or type in another branch you want to register\n    ```bash\n    $ igc pipeline -n dev\n    Project git repo: https://github.com/mjperrins/stockbffnode.git\n    ?

You can now access the app to test it.\n\n- To access the app, retrieve the app ingress endpoint using command below\n    ```bash\n    igc ingress -n dev\n    ```\n  \n  You will see a list of apps displayed with their ingress URLs\n    ```bash\n    Host(s):\n    [\n      'http://stockbffnode-dev.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'\n    ]\n\n- Open this ingress URL in your browser and validate the app is working as expected\n\n## Where is the App ?\n\n- The build pipeline has\n\n\n\n\nThis completes the deployment of your app.\n\n\n### Complete the setup\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n  **Note:** If you are working on a shared education cluster the following steps will have already been completed.
