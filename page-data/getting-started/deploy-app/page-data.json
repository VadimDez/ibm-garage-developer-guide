These have been created to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you need for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for **IBM Kubernetes** or **Red Hat OpenShift** managed service that have both had the Development environment installed.\n\nThis video will demonstrate how to work through the steps to create an application that uses a deployment pipeline to install it into your development cluster.\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<Video src=\"/videos/deployapp.m4v\" type=\"video/m4v\" poster=\"/images/poster.png\"/>\n\n### Log into you Development Cluster from the command line\n\n- Make sure you have installed all [Prerequisites](/admin/pre-reqs) before continuing\n- Open a terminal\n- log into your Development cluster in a terminal.\n- To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and\nfollow the instructions to login from the command line\n- You can test this with the following simple command.\n\n<Accordion>\n\n  <AccordionItem title=\"OpenShift\">\n\n    oc get nodes\n\n  </AccordionItem>\n\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n    kubectl get nodes\n\n  </AccordionItem>\n\n</Accordion>\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n### Open Developer Tools Dashboard\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n  **Warning:** If you are developing on a shared education cluster. You need to make it easy to identify your app please suffix the app name with your initials `{app name}-{your initials}` ie. `stockbffnode-mjp` and use the **Git Organisation** listed in your notification email.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nThe Developer Tools Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a section that allows you to select a set of preconfigured [Starter Kit Templates](/starterkits/overview) that make seeding your development project very easy.\n\n- Open a browser and make sure you are logged into [Github](https://github.com)\n- Open the [Developer Tools Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard)\n    ```\n    igc dashboard\n    ```\n- Click on **Starter Kits** tab\n- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that you prefer to work with.\n    - Click on a Starter Kit Template **Tile** to create your app github repository from the template repository selected.\n    - You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the source template repository and click on the **Template** to create the template\n\n- Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) process.\n\n  - **Owner**: Select a validate GitHub organization that you are authorised to create repositories within or the one you were given for the shared cluster education.\n  - **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo , github will help with showing a green tick if it is valid\n\n  - **Description**: Describe your app\n    ![Template](template.png)\n  - Press **Create repository from template**\n\nThe new repository will be created in your selected organization.\n- Next, clone it to your local machine.\n- Click on **Clone or download**\n- Copy the clone _SSH link_, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.\n    ```base\n    git clone git@github.com:mjperrins/stockbffnode.git\n    ```\n- Change into the cloned directory\n    ```\n    cd stockbffnode\n    ```\n- You must rename the app to match your git repo or to a unique name for your solution. Then applications move into a _test_ environment they need to unique names.\n- Edit `package.json` and edit the `name:` field and change it from its template name to your chosen name.\n- Save the edits\n- Push the changes back to your repository\n    ```\n    git add .\n    git push -m \"Update application name\"\n    ```\n\n### Running Locally\n\nMost developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. You may be required to install a specific runtime like **Java**, **Node**, or **Python**.\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n### Register the App in a DevOps Pipeline\n\n- You now have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment. You can now register the repository with the **Continuous Integration** pipeline technology.\n\n- The default Continuous Integration tool is currently **Jenkins**. [Tekton support is also supported](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)\n\n- You can use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to assist helping register a pipeline with Jenkins\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n  **Warning:** If you are working on a shared education cluster please deploy your app into a unique project/namespace and continue to do this for all other app creation steps. ie. `igc pipeline -n dev-{your initials}` ie. `dev-mjp`\n\n  This will isolate your pipelines into its own namespace/project from other developers working on the same cluster.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n- Register your repo using the `igc pipeline` command.
