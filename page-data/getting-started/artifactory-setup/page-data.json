The \n[IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry) \nstores Docker images, but has no support for storing other types of binary artifacts such as Maven, \nGradle jar files, NPM modules, and Helm charts. ArgoCD uses Artifactory as a Helm repository, \nand the Starter Kit Templates have also been configured to store their Helm charts in Artificatory.\n\nThe following guides explain the Developer Tools' combined CI/CD solution:\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/guides/continuous-integration\">Continuous Integration</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/guides/continuous-deployment\">Continuous Deployment</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n##  Configuration\n\nTo enable Artifactory to work seamlessly with the Developer Tools environment, you need to configure Artifactory to\nbe used as a Helm repository.\n\n- Open Artifactory from the [Developer Tools Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard) and login\n\nThe first time you log into Artifactory, it is unconfigured and displays its Onboarding Wizard, starting with the Welcome page.\n\n- Press **Next**\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![Initial JFrog](/images/initialjfrog.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\nThe next page in the wizard is the Configure a Proxy Server page. This is to setup a proxy for external resources. You can skip this\nstep.\n\n- Press **Skip**\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![Initial JFrog](/images/setupproxy.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\nThe next page in the wizard is the Create Repositories page.

Now that it is set, rerun your pipeline and check that the Helm chart for you app is stored correctly in Artifactory with matching semantic version information.\n\n- In the Artifactory console, select the Artifacts page and expand the `generic-local` repository\n\nYou should see a folder named after your resource group containing the tar file for a Helm chart.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![Artifact Repository Browser](/images/artifact-repo-browser.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nArtifactory is now set up in your Developer Tools environment and Jenkins pipelines can store Helm charts in Artifactory repository. \n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b34a5a6a1ff2b252fd4b67b73702125e","counter":486,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Artifactory Setup"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Artifactory Setup\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nComplete the steps for setting up Artifactory for use with development pipelines\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Overview\n\nArtifactory is a general purpose artifact storage service.
