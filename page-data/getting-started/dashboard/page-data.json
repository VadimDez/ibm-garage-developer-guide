**Jenkins**\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\nThe Dashboard is installed into your development cluster, it has been designed to give you a simple way of compeleting the following tasks.\n\n- Navigate to the installed tools within the cluster\n- Give you links to common **Activation** education to help you understand cloud native development with IBM Kubernetes Services and Red Had OpenShift\n- Links to **Starter Kit Templates** that will help accelerate your project\n\n## Opening the Dashboard\n\nTo open the Dashboard, use the [Cloud Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to obtain the ingress endpoint, \nthen use that endpoint to open the Dashboard.\n\nTo list the ingress endpoints for all the installed tools use the following command:\n\n```bash\nigc ingress -n tools\n```\n\nThis will return the ingress URLs.\n\n```bash\nHost(s):\n[\n  'https://grpc.argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',\n  'https://argocd.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',\n  'https://artifactory.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',\n

'https://pact.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud',\n  'https://sonarqube.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud'\n]\n```\n\nSelect the URL called `dashboard` and open it in your browser.\n\n\n### Credentials\n\nCurrently the tools are not linked to a single sign-on service (future plan other than Jenkins in OpenShift).\nTo obtain the credentials for the tools login into ibm cloud account on the command line and run `igc credentials` this \nwill list the `userids` and `passwords` secrets for each tool installed.\n```bash\nigc credentials\n```\n\nYou can use the credentials information to log into each of the installed tools.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nIf you are using OpenShift the Jenkins credential\nwill be `undefined` as OpenShift using single sign on mechanism with its built in Jenkins service.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"061295433d1ed2a12a7d8e256003174d","counter":421,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dashboard"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle:
