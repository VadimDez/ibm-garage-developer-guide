This will then enable you to access the development clusters for IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. The Resource group will have pre installed content and you will be restricted from creating new cloud services or deleting existing ones.\n\n- Each **Development Team** will consist of up to **25** Garage colleagues.\n\n### Team Allocation\n\nThe team names use the convention `mooc-team-one`, `mooc-team-two`,`mooc-team-n..` you will have received you team name in your notification email.\n\nThe following diagram helps to explain how access will be configured.

The administrators will be monitoring the cluster to identify any possible issues early and resolving them.\n\n- You will be given access to a team git organization. You will be expected to create all your git projects in your teams organization. This is how real world development projects work. This will enable you to collaborate with your fellow team members and will prevent you from creating duplicate projects names.\n\n![MOOC Teams](moocteams.png)\n\nThere will an IBM Kubernetes Cluster in the same `Resource Group` and you will get bonus _credits_ if you can deliver some of the home work onto that cluster as well.

The use of the team git organization will help with this but again please follow this approach.\n- Talk to you fellow team members using slack to help debug issues\n- Do not delete anything that is not yours in the cluster especially `secrets` and `configMaps` this will cause unnecessary pain for [master builders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-PlX6oPBQ)\n- Do not delete other peoples `pipelines` or `deployed apps`\n- Do not create anything that will cause unnecessary stress to your teams Red Hat Cluster or the `MOOC Account`\n- Remember part of the learning is showing you how to be team members working on multiple microservices in the same development cluster with other developers.\n- Remember running an app on your laptop does not trump running code in a cluster\n- Remember IBM Cloud is like one big Lego Set of software and services.
