The analysis is structured as a set of coding rules that evaluate the code's quality. \nAnalysis can be performed on source code or compiled code. The analyzer must support the programming lanuage\nthe code is written in so that it can parse the code like a compiler or simulate its execution.\n\nStatic code analysis differs from dynamic analysis, which observes and evaluates a running program. Dynamic analysis \nrequires test inputs and can meansure runtime qualities like execution time and resource consumption. A code review is \nstatic code analysis performed by a human.\n\nStatic code analysis can evaluate several different aspects of code quality:\n- **Reliability**\n    - **Bug**: Programming error that breaks functionality\n- **Security**\n    - **Vulnerability**: A point in a program that can be attacked\n    - **Hotspot**: Code that uses a security-sensitive API\n- **Maintainability**\n    - **Coding standards**: Practices that increase the human readability and undestandability of code\n    - **Code smell**: Code that is confusing and difficult to maintain\n    - **Technical debt**: Estimated time required to fix all maintainability issues\n- **Complexity**\n    - **Code complexity**: Code's control flow and number of paths through the code\n- **Duplications**\n    - **Duplicated code**: The same code sequence appearing more than once in the same program\n- **Manageability**\n    - **Testability**: How easily tests can be developed and used to show the program meets requirements\n    - **Portability**: How easily the program can be reused in different environments\n    - **Reusability**: The program's modularity, loose coupling, and limited interdependencies\n\nStatic code analysis collects several metrics that measure code quality:\n- **Issues**\n    - **Type**: Bug, Vunerability, Code Smell\n    - **Sevarity**\n        - **Blocker**: Bug with a high probability to impact the behavior of the application in production\n        - **Critical**: Bug with a low probability to impact the behavior of the application in production, or a security vulnerability\n        - **Major**: Code smell with high impact to developer productivity\n        - **Minor**: Code smell with slight impact to developer productivity\n        - **Info**: Neither a bug nor a code smell, just a finding\n- **Size**\n    - **Classes**: Number of class definitions (concrete, abstract, nested, interfaces, enums, annotations)\n    - **Lines of code**: Linespace seperated text that is not whitespace or comments\n    - **Comment lines**: Linespace seperated text containing significant commentary or commented-out code\n- **Tests**\n    - **Test coverage**: Code that was executed by a test suite\n\n## What is SonarQube\n\nSonarQube performs static code analysis to evaluate code quality, using static code analysis rules that focus on three areas:\n- **Code Reliability**: Detect bugs that will impact end-user functionality\n- **Application Security**: Detect vulnerabilities and hotspots that can be exploited to compromise the program\n- **Technical Debt**: Keep you codebase maintainable to increase developer velocity\n\nSonarQube [plugs into the application lifecycle management (ALM)](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/architecture/architecture-integration/#header-2) process to make continuous inspection part of continuous integration. \nAdding code analysis to the ALM provides regular, timely feedback on the quality of the code being produced. \nThe goal is to detect problems as soon as possible so that they can be resolved before they can impact production end users.\n\nThe continuous integration (CI) server itegrates SonarQube into the ALM.\nThe SonarQube solution consists of several components: The central component is the SonarQube Server, \nwhich runs the SonarScanner, processes the resulting analysis reports, stores the reports in SonarQube Database, \nand displays the reports in the SonarQube UI. \nA CI server uses a stage/goal/task in its build automation to trigger SonarScanner to scan the code being built. \nDevelopers can view the resulting analysis report in the SonarQube UI.\n\n## Code Analysis in the Pipeline\n\nIn the [Jenkins pipeline](/guides/continuous-integration), the *Sonar scan* stage triggers the SonarScanner in SonarQube.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9bca693764e7b7c79b0f2479c54b4f3f","counter":365,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Code Analysis"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Code Analysis\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis guide will explain how to use SonarQube to analyze your code's quality\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nSonarQube automates performing static code analysis.\n\n## What is code analysis \n\nStatic code analysis (a.k.a. code analysis) is a method of debugging by performing automated evaluation of code \nwithout executing the program.
