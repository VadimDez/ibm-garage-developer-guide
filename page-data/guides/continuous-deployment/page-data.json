This will enable the use of Helm charts that are included in the applications to be de-coupled from the image that is build with the CI pipeline with Jenkins. There is an sample in this repository that directly references the image from the IBM Cloud Image Registry if you do not want to use helm charts from a registery.\n\n### Update Config Map for Argo CD\n\nIn the `config` directory there is a `yaml` file called `argocd-helm-repo.yaml`. Edit this file and modify the `- url:` to point to the URL of the Artificatory Repository. \n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-cm\n  namespace: tools\ndata:\n  helm.repositories: |\n    - url: http://artifactory.catalyst-team-iks-cluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/artifactory/generic-local/catalyst-team/\n      name: catalyst-team\n```\n\nIf you have configured the Artifactory instance to store Helm charts from your CI pipeline with Jenkins. You can easily get this value by Logging into Artifactory and clicking on `Setup Me Up` tile and click on the repository `generic-local` \n\n![Setup](./images/setupartifactory.png \"Setup Screen\")\n\nThis will open the detailed setup view and from here you can copy the URL from the setup screen.\n\n![Setup](./images/artifactoryurlsetup.png \"Setup Screen\")\n\n### Run the Kubectl Command\n\nNow you have edited the yamp you need to make sure you logged into the Command Line with either IBM Kubernetes Service or Red Hat OpenShift instructions. \n\nYou can test this by running the following commands :\n\n```bash \nkubectl get nodes | oc get nodes\n```\n\nThere is a helper shell script that you can run call `updateArgo.sh` this runs the following command to add the details of the Helm Registry with ArgoCD Config map.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nkubectl apply -f argocd-helm-repo.yaml\n```\n\nOnce this is complete you can validate the configuration by opening the Config Map in the IKS Console or OpenShift Cluster Console. Navigate to the `tools` namespace and view the `Config Maps` open up the config map called `argocd-cm` and validate the the `Data` section now has a `helm.repositorys` entry that is referencing Artifactory.  \n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6d69488dc76637b1f9b660ae2f3899eb","counter":191,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Continuous Deployment"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Continuous Deployment\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis project is a [Gatsby theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) that empowers developers, writers, and designers to create fast, accessible sites that look and feel like Carbon.
