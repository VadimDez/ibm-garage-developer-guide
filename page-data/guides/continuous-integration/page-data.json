This automation can be tailored to the specific project requirements.\n\nYou can read more information about Jenkins Pipelines [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)\n\n### Stages\n\nPipelines are defined in a `Jenkinsfile` that sits in the root of your application code. It defines a number of stages. Each of the `Starter Kit Templates` includes a `Jenkinsfile` that offers a number of stages. The stages have been configured to complete the build, test, package, and deploy of the application code. Each stage can use the defined defined `secrets` and `config maps` that were previously configured during the installation of Development cluster setup.\n\n## Developer Tools Pipeline\n\nTo enable application compatibility between Kubernetes and OpenShift, the `Jenkinsfile` is consistent between pipeline registration with\nboth platforms. Also, the Docker images are built from \n[UBI images](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) \nso that their containers can run on both platforms.\n\nThese are the stages in the pipeline and a description of what each stage does. The **bold stage names** indicate \nthe stages that are required; the ***italics stage names*** indicate optional stages that can be deleted or will be ignored if the tool \nsupporting the stage is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a cloud-native application.\n- **Setup**: Clones the code into the pipeline\n- **Build**: Runs the build commands for the code\n- **Test**:\tValidates the unit tests for the code\n- ***Publish pacts***:\tPublishes any pact contracts that have been defined\n- ***Sonar scan***: Runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube\n- **Verify environment**: Validates the OpenShift or IKS environment configuration is valid\n- **Build image**: Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry\n- **Deploy to DEV env**:\tDeploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart\n- **Health Check**: Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application\n- ***Package Helm Chart***: Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart in Artifactory\n- ***Trigger CD Pipeline***: This is a GitOps stage that will update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for deployment to **test**\n\n## Registering Pipelines\n\nThe [Starter Kit Templates](/starterkits/starterkittemplates/) are a good place to start to see how `Jenkinsfile` and `Dockerfile` should be configured for use in a Jenkins CI pipeline. To register your git repo, use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli). This command automates a number of manual steps you would have to do with Jenkins, including: managing secrets, webhooks, and pipeline registration in the Jenkins tools.\n\n```bash\nigc pipeline\n```\n\nBy default, the pipeline will register into the `dev` namespace and will copy all the `configMaps` and `secrets` from the `tools` namespace to the `dev` namespace. This means the pipeline can execute, knowing it has access to the key information that enables it to integrate with both the cloud platform and the various development tools. See [Cluster Configuration](/guides/cluster-configuration) for more detailed information.\n\n### Registering Pipeline in new namespace\n\nYou can use any namespace you want to register a pipeline. If you add `-n` or `namespace` to your `igc pipeline` command, it will create a new namespace if it doesn't already exist and copy the necessary `secrets` and `configMaps`. In the future, this will be managed by an operator.\n\n```bash\nigc pipeline -n team-a\n```\n\nYou will also need to change the namespace in your `Jenkinsfile`. Search for this and update it to the same name you used for your namespace. Edit the `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` value in your `Jenkinsfile` to match the namespace you targeted for you CI deployment.\n\n```bash\nenv:\n    - name: CHART_NAME\n      value: template-node-typescript\n    - name: CHART_ROOT\n      value: chart\n    - name: TMP_DIR\n      value: .tmp\n    - name: HOME\n      value: /home/devops\n    - name: ENVIRONMENT_NAME\n      value: team-a\n    - name: BUILD_NUMBER\n      value: ${env.BUILD_NUMBER}\n\n```\n\nThis is good if you have various squads or pairs working in the same Development Tools environment.\n\n## Continious deployment\n\nIn addition to continous integration, the Developer Tools environment also supports continous deployment \nusing Artifactory and ArgoCD:\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/guides/artifact-management\">Artifact Storage with Artifactory</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/guides/continuous-deployment\">Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\nYou can use the [Argo CD Template](/starterkits/argocd) to help define a deployment configuration for `test` and `staging` namespaces.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5bcbdab30afe3cbd78f4b9cc4682337a","counter":279,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Continuous Integration with Jenkins"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Continuous Integration with Jenkins\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis guide will explain how to use Jenkins to manage your Continuous Integration process\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nContinuous integration is a software development technique where software is built regularly by a team in an automated fashion.\nThis quote helps explain it:\n\n> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently,\n> usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day.\n> Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to\n> detect integration errors as quickly as possible.
