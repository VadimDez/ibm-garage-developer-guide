Most of the times one would not use the binary repository directly but through a package manager that comes with the chosen technology.\n\nIn most cases these will store individual application components that can later be assembled into a full product - thus allowing a build to be broken in smaller chunks, making more efficient use of resources, reducing build times, better tracking of binary debug databases etc.\n\nHere are some of the most popular package managers that can be managed using a binary repository:\n\nJava: jar, ear, war etc has Maven and the official MavenCentral.

The initial investment is not very large and the benefits are felt immediately.
